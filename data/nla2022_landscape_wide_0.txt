"PERDUN"	"Dunne overland flow, also know as saturation overland flow, is generated in a basin when the water table \outcrops\\" on the land surface (due to the infiltration and redistribution of soil moisture within the basin), thereby producing temporary saturated areas. These saturated areas generate Dunne overland flow through exfiltration of shallow ground water and by routing precipitation directly to the stream network. The data are estimated from a watershed simulation model called TOPMODEL (Wolock, 1993). The model was run  throughout the conterminous U.S. and estimated percentage of Dunne overland flow in total streamflow was quantified (Wolock, 2003).\""			"http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?satof48"

The data are estimated from a watershed simulation model called TOPMODEL (Wolock, 1993).
